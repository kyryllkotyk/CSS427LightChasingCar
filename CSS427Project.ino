// Front, Back, Right, Left

// If left/right & back/forward are similar, both forward and side can happen at once Â || vector sums
// since the steering doesn't auto center, we must choose when to center the car again
// maybe a checker that verifies whether the given direction state is currently true?

// current state tracker that tells you where you're going now.
// desired direction tracker that tells you where the car wants to go
// check whether current state == desired direction

// Smaller priority but still should be done by the end:
// add deadzones to ignore small light difference
// add smoothing that would make sure the input is stable
// reset if stuck in state for a while
// speed adjustment based on turn vs straight line
